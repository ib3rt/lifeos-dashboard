## Recurring Patterns

### Delegation Pattern
For tasks >5 min or complex: spawn sub-agent, report back.
```
sessions_spawn(
  task="detailed description",
  runTimeoutSeconds=300,
  cleanup="delete"
)
```

### Token Economy
- Estimate cost before multi-step
- Ask permission for >$0.50
- Batch operations
- Prefer local files

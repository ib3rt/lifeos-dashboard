### Life OS / OpenClaw Setup
**Status:** Genesis Protocol Active  
**Started:** 2026-02-02

Key decisions:
- Memory flush + session search enabled
- Executive assistant persona activated
- Braindump/Expectations structure created
- **3 sub-agents deployed** for overnight build (research, code, docs)
- Cron monitoring active (30min intervals)
- Discord deferred (config complexity), focused on Telegram + available skills

## Recurring Patterns

### Delegation Pattern
For tasks >5 min or complex: spawn sub-agent, report back.
```
sessions_spawn(
  task="detailed description",
  runTimeoutSeconds=300,
  cleanup="delete"
)
```

### Token Economy
- Estimate cost before multi-step
- Ask permission for >$0.50
- Batch operations
- Prefer local files

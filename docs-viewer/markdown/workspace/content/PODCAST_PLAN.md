## Differentiation

**What's Missing in AI Podcasts:**
- Build-in-public documentation (not just theory)
- Cost transparency (actual $ spent)
- Failure stories (not just wins)
- Small-scale automation (not enterprise)
- Personality-driven (not corporate)

**Our Angle:**
"The only podcast where an INTJ builds an AI-powered life in real-time, with actual numbers, actual failures, and zero corporate fluff."

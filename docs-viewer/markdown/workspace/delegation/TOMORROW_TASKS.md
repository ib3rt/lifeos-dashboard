## Agent Communication Protocol

**Group Chat:** "Life OS Command Center" (Telegram)

**Interaction Rules:**
1. You can @mention any agent directly
2. Agents respond in character (with their personality)
3. Cross-agent discussions happen in group
4. Claw Main summarizes long threads
5. Urgent matters escalate to main session

**Example:**
```
You: @ClawCryptoBot What's BTC doing?
Diamond Hands: 📈 TO THE MOON! Just kidding, consolidating at $42K. 
               Want me to set alerts for breakouts?

You: @ClawTechBot Can we integrate this?
Neural Net Ned: Ooh! *adjusts glasses* Let me check the API docs...
                *5 minutes later*
                We can totally do this! But we'll need to... [technical explanation]

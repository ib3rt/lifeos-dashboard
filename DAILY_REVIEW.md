# Daily Review Checklist

## Every Session Start

- [ ] Read `SOUL.md` — who I am
- [ ] Read `USER.md` — who I'm helping
- [ ] Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` — today's context
- [ ] Read `MEMORY.md` — curated long-term memory

## File Health Check

- [ ] SOUL.md up to date (channels, philosophy)
- [ ] USER.md accurate (projects, preferences)
- [ ] MEMORY.md current (recent wins, active projects)
- [ ] No merge conflicts in main files

## Weekly Tasks

- [ ] Consolidate daily logs → MEMORY.md
- [ ] Archive old memory files
- [ ] Review active projects status
- [ ] Update external integrations if changed

## Quick Audit Command

```bash
./tools/daily-review.sh
```

This checks file dates, git status, and flags outdated content.

## 1. LLC (Limited Liability Company)

### Overview
The Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a hybrid entity combining the liability protection of a corporation with the tax flexibility and operational simplicity of a partnership.

### Key Characteristics
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Liability Protection** | Members generally not personally liable for business debts |
| **Tax Treatment** | Pass-through by default; can elect corporate taxation |
| **Management** | Flexible (member-managed or manager-managed) |
| **Formalities** | Fewer than corporations; no required board meetings |
| **Ownership** | Unlimited members; can include individuals, corporations, trusts |
| **Transferability** | Restricted without operating agreement provisions |

### Tax Classifications
- **Single-Member LLC**: Disregarded entity (Schedule C for individuals)
- **Multi-Member LLC**: Partnership taxation (Form 1065, K-1s)
- **Elective Status**: Can elect S-Corp or C-Corp taxation via Form 8832

### Advantages
- Simplicity of formation and maintenance
- Charging order protection (in most states)
- Flexible profit/loss allocation
- No double taxation (default status)
- Credibility with customers and vendors

### Disadvantages
- Self-employment taxes on all income (default status)
- Limited outside investment options
- State-level fees vary significantly
- Less established case law than corporations

---

## 2. S-Corporation

### Overview
An S-Corporation is not a separate entity type but a tax election available to qualifying corporations and LLCs, permitting pass-through taxation while maintaining corporate structure.

### Eligibility Requirements (Strict)
- Must be a domestic corporation/LLC
- Maximum 100 shareholders
- Only one class of stock
- Shareholders must be individuals, estates, or certain trusts (NO corporations, partnerships, or non-resident aliens)
- All shareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliens

### Key Characteristics
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tax Treatment** | Pass-through; no entity-level income tax |
| **Self-Employment Tax** | Only on reasonable salary, not distributions |
| **Formalities** | Must maintain corporate formalities (meetings, minutes, bylaws) |
| **Transferability** | Stock freely transferable (subject to restrictions) |

### Advantages
- Self-employment tax savings on distributions
- Pass-through taxation avoids double taxation
- Separate legal entity provides liability protection
- Business losses pass through to shareholders
- Perceived credibility for certain industries

### Disadvantages
- **Strict qualification requirements**
- Reasonable salary requirements (IRS scrutiny risk)
- Limited to one class of stock
- State taxes may still apply at entity level
- Formal corporate maintenance required
- Cannot have corporate or foreign shareholders

---

## 3. C-Corporation

### Overview
The C-Corporation is the traditional corporate form, providing the strongest liability shield but subjecting profits to double taxation (entity level + shareholder level).

### Key Characteristics
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Tax Treatment** | Entity-level taxation; dividends taxed again at shareholder level |
| **Ownership** | Unlimited; any person or entity, foreign or domestic |
| **Stock Classes** | Multiple classes permitted |
| **Capital Raising** | Optimal structure for venture capital and public offerings |
| **Formalities** | Strictest requirements (board, officers, annual meetings, minutes) |

### Advantages
- Strongest liability protection
- Unlimited growth potential
- Easy transfer of ownership via stock
- No restrictions on ownership type/number
- Business expenses and benefits (health insurance, retirement plans)
- Accumulated earnings for growth (within reasonable limits)
- QSBS potential (Qualified Small Business Stock - Section 1202 exclusion)

### Disadvantages
- **Double taxation** (unless profits reinvested)
- Complex compliance requirements
- Higher administrative costs
- No personal tax deductions for corporate losses
- Accumulated earnings tax risk

## 4. Holding Company Structure

### Overview
A holding company structure involves a parent entity that owns controlling interests in subsidiary operating companies, providing asset isolation and operational flexibility.

### Common Configurations

```
Configuration A: Operating Holdings
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│    Parent Holding Co.       │
│    (LLC or Corporation)     │
└─────────────┬───────────────┘
              │
    ┌─────────┼─────────┐
    ▼         ▼         ▼
┌───────┐ ┌───────┐ ┌───────┐
│Sub A  │ │Sub B  │ │Sub C  │
│(Tech) │ │(Real  │ │(IP    │
│       │ │Estate)│ │Hold)  │
└───────┘ └───────┘ └───────┘

Configuration B: Asset Protection
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│    Operating Company        │
│    (Holds minimal assets)   │
└─────────────────────────────┘
              │
              │ leases/uses
              ▼
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│    Asset Holding Company    │
│    (Owns equipment, IP, RE) │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### Advantages
- **Asset Isolation**: Liabilities in one subsidiary don't jeopardize others
- **Risk Segmentation**: Separate high-risk activities from valuable assets
- **Operational Flexibility**: Different business lines under unified ownership
- **Estate Planning**: Easier transfer of specific business units
- **Financing**: Can leverage assets at holding company level

### Disadvantages
- Increased complexity and administrative burden
- Multiple state filings and fees
- Potential consolidated return complexities
- Intercompany transaction scrutiny
- Transfer pricing considerations

### Tax Considerations
- Section 351 transfers may allow tax-free formation
- Consolidated tax returns possible for affiliated groups (C-Corps)
- Intercompany dividends may qualify for 100% DRD (Dividends Received Deduction)
- Watch for §163(j) interest limitation rules

## 5. Series LLC

### Overview
A Series LLC permits the creation of separate "series" or "cells" within a single LLC, each with its own assets, liabilities, and operations—functionally similar to subsidiaries without separate entity formation.

### Available Jurisdictions
| State | Year Enacted | Notable Features |
|-------|--------------|------------------|
| **Delaware** | 1996 | Strongest case law; business-friendly courts |
| **Nevada** | 2005 | Strong asset protection; no state income tax |
| **Wyoming** | 2012 | Excellent privacy; strong charging order protection |
| **Illinois** | 2005 | First non-Delaware state; specific statutory framework |
| **Texas** | 2009 | Large economy; real estate focus |
| Others | Various | ~15 states total; laws vary significantly |

### How It Works
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│      Master/Series LLC          │
│    (Filed with State)           │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Series A: Real Estate Holdings  │
│ Series B: Operating Business    │
│ Series C: IP Portfolio          │
│ Series D: Investment Holdings   │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
Each series has:
- Separate assets and liabilities
- Separate books and records
- Separate members (optional)
```

### Advantages
- **Cost Efficiency**: One filing fee vs. multiple entities
- **Administrative Simplicity**: One EIN, one tax return (usually)
- **Liability Segregation**: Each series' liabilities isolated
- **Flexibility**: Add series without state filings
- **Privacy**: Series not typically public record

### Disadvantages
- **Uncertainty**: Limited case law on series liability protection
- **Recognition Issues**: Not all states recognize series LLCs
- **Foreign Qualification**: May need to register entire LLC in other states
- **Banking Complexity**: Some banks struggle with series accounts
- **Tax Uncertainty**: IRS has not issued definitive guidance

### Critical Tax Warning
**The IRS has NOT issued definitive regulations on Series LLC taxation.** Current guidance suggests each series may be treated as a separate entity for federal tax purposes, but this is not settled law. The check-the-box regulations (§301.7701) do not explicitly address series LLCs.

## 6. Offshore Options

### Overview
Offshore jurisdictions offer various structures for international tax planning, asset protection, and business operations—**HOWEVER**, U.S. persons face extensive reporting requirements and anti-deferral regimes.

### Cayman Islands

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Exempted Company (most common) |
| **Taxation** | No income, capital gains, or withholding taxes |
| **Confidentiality** | High; no public beneficial ownership register |
| **Requirements** | At least one director; registered office in Cayman |
| **Costs** | $3,000-5,000 formation; $3,000+ annual |

**U.S. Tax Considerations:**
- CFC (Controlled Foreign Corporation) rules apply if >50% owned by U.S. shareholders
- GILTI (Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income) tax on certain income
- PFIC (Passive Foreign Investment Company) rules for passive income
- Extensive Form 5471 reporting required
- FBAR reporting if foreign accounts >$10,000 aggregate

### British Virgin Islands (BVI)

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structure** | BVI Business Company (BC) |
| **Taxation** | No BVI taxes on profits, dividends, or capital gains |
| **Confidentiality** | High; no public register of directors or shareholders |
| **Flexibility** | Can be structured similarly to any jurisdiction's company |
| **Costs** | $1,500-3,000 formation; $1,500+ annual |

**U.S. Tax Considerations:**
- Same CFC/GILTI/PFIC concerns as Cayman
- Economic substance requirements may apply
- CRS (Common Reporting Standard) exchange of information

### Singapore

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Structure** | Private Limited Company (Pte. Ltd.) |
| **Taxation** | 17% corporate rate; territorial system; extensive treaty network |
| **Requirements** | At least one resident director; local registered address |
| **Substance** | Strong economic substance requirements |
| **Costs** | $2,000-4,000 formation; $2,000+ annual |

**U.S. Tax Considerations:**
- U.S.-Singapore tax treaty provides benefits
- Same CFC/GILTI reporting obligations
- May qualify for foreign tax credits
- Substantial business purpose required

### Offshore Compliance Warning

U.S. persons using offshore entities face **SEVERE PENALTIES** for non-compliance:

| Form | Requirement | Penalty for Non-Filing |
|------|-------------|------------------------|
| **FBAR (FinCEN 114)** | Report foreign accounts >$10,000 | Up to $10,000 per violation; willful violations up to $100,000 or 50% of account |
| **Form 5471** | Information return for CFCs | $10,000 per form; additional penalties for continued non-filing |
| **Form 8938** | Statement of Specified Foreign Assets | $10,000 initial; up to $50,000 for continued failure |
| **Form 8621** | PFIC information return | $10,000 per PFIC |

**The U.S. taxes its citizens on worldwide income.** Offshore structures do NOT eliminate U.S. tax obligations absent specific treaty benefits or foreign tax credits. **Proper structuring requires specialized international tax counsel.**

## Red Flags and Common Mistakes

### STRUCTURAL MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Commingling Funds** - Using business accounts for personal expenses pierces the corporate veil
2. **Inadequate Capitalization** - Under-funding entities exposes members to liability
3. **Ignoring Formalities** - Failing to maintain separate records, minutes, meetings
4. **Missing Elections** - Failing to timely file S-Corp elections (must be filed within 2.5 months of tax year start)
5. **Improper Asset Transfers** - Transferring assets without proper documentation or consideration
6. **DIY Operating Agreements** - Using generic templates without customization to your situation
7. **Ignoring State Qualification** - Operating in a state without registering/qualifying

### TAX MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. **Unreasonable S-Corp Salary** - Taking too little salary invites IRS reclassification
2. **Missing Estimated Payments** - Failing to pay quarterly estimated taxes
3. **Improper Deductions** - Claiming personal expenses as business deductions
4. **Self-Dealing** - Transactions between related entities without arm's length terms
5. **Offshore Non-Compliance** - Failing to file required international information returns

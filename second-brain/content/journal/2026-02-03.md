# February 3, 2026

## Morning Reflection

Today I'm working on building a [[Second Brain]] application that combines the best features of [[Obsidian]] and [[Linear]]. It's exciting to create a tool that I'll actually use daily.

The vision is clear:
- Dark, Obsidian-like interface for comfortable long sessions
- Linear-inspired smooth animations and interactions
- Full Markdown support with wiki-style links
- Automatic backlinks and tag organization

## What I Learned

### Next.js App Router

The App Router in Next.js 14+ is powerful but has some nuances:
- Server components by default
- Async components for data fetching
- Simplified data loading patterns

### Tailwind Typography

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin (prose classes) makes rendering Markdown content beautiful with minimal effort:

```css
.prose prose-invert {
  /* Automatic dark mode typography */
}
```

## Today's Wins

1. ✅ Set up Next.js project with TypeScript
2. ✅ Implemented document parsing with gray-matter
3. ✅ Built sidebar navigation with categories
4. ✅ Created document viewer with backlinks

## Tomorrow's Plan

- [ ] Add full-text search functionality
- [ ] Implement tag browsing
- [ ] Create daily journal view
- [ ] Deploy to Vercel

## Random Thought

The best tools are the ones that get out of your way. I want this Second Brain to feel like an extension of my mind, not another app to manage.

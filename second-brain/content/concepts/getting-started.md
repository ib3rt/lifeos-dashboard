# Getting Started with Second Brain

Welcome to your **Second Brain** - a personal knowledge management system that combines the best of [[Obsidian]]'s linked thinking with [[Linear]]'s polished user interface.

## What is Second Brain?

A Second Brain is a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, insights, and connections we've gained through experience. It's an external digital repository for the things you learn and the resources you encounter.

## Key Features

### 📝 Document Management
- **Markdown-based**: All documents use standard Markdown with YAML frontmatter
- **Categories**: Organize content into Journal, Concepts, Projects, and Reference
- **Full-text Search**: Quickly find any document or content

### 🔗 Linked Thinking
- **Backlinks**: See which documents link to the current one
- **Wiki-style links**: Use `[[Document Name]]` to link between documents
- **Tag system**: Categorize and filter content with tags

### 🎨 Beautiful Interface
- **Dark mode by default**: Easy on the eyes for long sessions
- **Smooth animations**: Linear-inspired transitions and interactions
- **Responsive design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Document Structure

All documents live in the `content/` folder with this structure:

```
content/
├── journal/       # Daily thoughts and reflections
├── concepts/      # Ideas and knowledge
├── projects/      # Project documentation
└── reference/     # Reference materials
```

## Creating New Documents

To create a new document:

1. Create a `.md` file in the appropriate folder
2. Add YAML frontmatter at the top:

```yaml
---

tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]

description: "Brief description of the document"
---
```

3. Write your content using Markdown

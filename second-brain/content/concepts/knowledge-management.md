# Knowledge Management Principles

Effective [[Personal Knowledge Management]] (PKM) is about more than just collecting information. It's about creating a system that helps you think better, connect ideas, and retrieve knowledge when you need it.

## The CODE Framework

The CODE framework, developed by Tiago Forte, provides a simple process for managing knowledge:

### 1. Capture
Keep what resonates. Don't save everything - be selective about what captures your attention.

**Tools for capture:**
- Quick notes
- Highlights from reading
- Voice memos
- Screenshots

### 2. Organize
Put things where they belong. Use the PARA method:

- **Projects**: Short-term efforts with deadlines
- **Areas**: Long-term responsibilities
- **Resources**: Reference materials
- **Archives**: Inactive items

### 3. Distill
Find the essence. Progressive summarization helps you extract the most valuable insights:

1. First pass: Capture the raw note
2. Second pass: Bold key passages
3. Third pass: Highlight the best parts
4. Fourth pass: Write an executive summary

### 4. Express
Share your knowledge. The ultimate purpose of a Second Brain is to create output:
- Blog posts
- Presentations
- Projects
- Conversations

## The Power of Connections

### Links Create Context

When you link notes together, you create context that makes each note more valuable. A note in isolation is just a fact. A note connected to others becomes knowledge.

### Emergent Insights

Connections between ideas often reveal insights that weren't apparent in the individual notes. This is where creativity happens.

## Best Practices

1. **Write for your future self**: Will you understand this in 6 months?
2. **Use your own words**: Don't just copy-paste
3. **Keep atomic notes**: One idea per note
4. **Link liberally**: Connect everything relevant
5. **Review regularly**: Spaced repetition for your notes

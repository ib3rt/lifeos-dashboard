# Zettelkasten Method

The Zettelkasten (German for "slip box") is a note-taking and knowledge management method developed by German sociologist [[Niklas Luhmann]]. It's the foundation of many modern PKM systems.

## Core Principles

### 1. Atomic Notes

Each note should contain **one idea and one idea only**. This makes notes:
- Easy to understand in isolation
- Highly reusable across different contexts
- Simple to connect to other notes

### 2. Unique Identifiers

Every note gets a unique ID (typically a number). This allows for:
- Precise linking between notes
- Flexibility in organization
- Non-hierarchical structure

### 3. Links Over Hierarchy

Instead of folders and subfolders, the Zettelkasten relies on:
- **Sequential links**: Notes that follow a train of thought
- **Reference links**: Connections to related ideas
- **Index notes**: Entry points to topics

## Types of Notes

### Fleeting Notes
Quick, temporary captures of ideas. Processed and discarded or converted to permanent notes.

### Literature Notes
Notes about something you've read. Include:
- Source citation
- Key ideas in your own words
- Your thoughts and reactions

### Permanent Notes
The core of your Zettelkasten. Each should:
- Stand alone (make sense without context)
- Be written in complete sentences
- Include links to related notes
- Use your own words

## The Power of Emergence

When you have hundreds or thousands of interconnected notes, something magical happens:

> "The Zettelkasten is a conversation partner." - Niklas Luhmann

Unexpected connections emerge. New ideas form at the intersection of existing ones.

## Modern Implementation

Digital tools make Zettelkasten easier than ever:
- Automatic backlinks
- Full-text search
- Graph visualization
- Mobile capture

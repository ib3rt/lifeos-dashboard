# 🎙️ The Life OS Podcast — Production Plan

> *Building an AI-powered life, one episode at a time.*

---

## 🎯 Show Concept & Positioning

### The Hook
Most AI podcasts talk ABOUT the technology. We talk about LIVING WITH IT.

**The Life OS Podcast** is a practical, fast-paced show documenting one person's journey to build a fully AI-powered life. No theory. No enterprise use cases. Just real experiments, real wins, and real failures as we assemble the ultimate personal operating system using AI agents, automation, and smart tools.

### The Gap We're Filling

| Existing Shows | What They Cover | What's Missing |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Latent Space** | AI engineering, Software 3.0, foundation models | Personal application, non-engineers |
| **No Priors** | AI investing, startup strategy, industry trends | Individual productivity, daily workflows |
| **TWIML** | Research papers, enterprise ML | Practical implementation for individuals |
| **Everyday AI** | Business productivity, company automation | Personal life OS, agent ecosystems |
| **How I AI** | Personal workflows (NEW—only 5 episodes) | Deep-dive build logs, systematic approach |

**The Opportunity:** No one is systematically documenting the construction of a personal AI ecosystem. We're not reviewing tools—we're BUILDING with them. Live. Transparent. Messy. Real.

### Target Audience

**Primary:** Tech-curious professionals (25-45) who want to:
- Automate the boring parts of life
- Stay current on AI tools without drowning in hype
- See real implementation, not marketing fluff

**Secondary:** 
- AI tool creators seeking authentic user feedback
- Productivity enthusiasts looking for the next level
- Developers building personal agent systems

**Overlap with Life OS Users:** 100%. This IS the user. They're watching someone solve the exact problems they have.

## 🎧 Format Architecture

### Multi-Format Approach (The Secret Sauce)

| Format | Length | Frequency | Content |
|--------|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Tool Reviews** | 10-15 min | 2x/week | Quick hits on new AI tools, tested live |
| **Build Logs** | 25-35 min | Weekly | Deep dives into constructing Life OS components |
| **Agent Spotlights** | 45-60 min | Bi-weekly | Interviews with tool creators |
| **Workflow Breakdowns** | 15-20 min | Weekly | "How I automated X" — specific, tactical |
| **State of the OS** | 30-40 min | Monthly | System overview, what's working, what's broken |

### Recommended Mix (Starting Out)

**Phase 1 (Launch):** 1 episode/week, 30-45 min hybrid format
- Start with Build Logs (the core differentiator)
- Add Tool Reviews as bonus/quick episodes
- Introduce interviews at Episode 10+

### Solo vs Co-Host vs Interview

**Solo (Primary)** — Shows 1-20
- Authentic "I'm figuring this out" energy
- Faster iteration, no scheduling friction
- Direct relationship with audience
- Can pivot format instantly based on feedback

**Interview (Secondary)** — Starting Show 10
- Agent Spotlights bring credibility
- Cross-pollinate audiences with tool creators
- Break up solo format to prevent monotony

**Co-Host (Future)** — Phase 3 consideration
- Add when there's a clear second voice (Life OS power user?)
- Could be rotating co-hosts based on expertise

3. **The Contenders (4-12 min):**
   - Notion AI (the incumbent)
   - Mem.ai (the pure AI play)

**Type:** Build Log  
**Length:** 35-40 minutes  
**Release:** Week 3

**Outline:**
1. **Hook (0-3 min):** "What if you started every day with exactly the information you need, delivered by an agent that learned your priorities?"
2. **The Problem (3-8 min):** Morning information overload: email, calendar, news, tasks, weather, stocks—too many apps
3. **The Vision (8-12 min):** One briefing document, auto-generated, personalized, delivered at 7 AM
4. **The Build (12-30 min):**
   - Tool selection: n8n vs Make vs custom script
   - Data sources: Calendar API, email summary, RSS feeds, weather
   - The prompt engineering: "You're my executive assistant..."
   - First test: "Oh no, it sent me 3 pages of text"
   - Iteration: Adding filters, formatting, voice option
5. **Current Status (30-35 min):** It works! (Sort of.) What's still broken.
6. **Lessons Learned (35-38 min):** What I'd do differently
7. **CTA (38-40 min):** Subscribe for Week 2 update. What's your morning friction?

**Key Moments:**
- The "it actually worked" moment (record live reaction if possible)
- The failure: "This is what happens when you trust AI with your calendar"
- The iteration: "Version 1 vs Version 3—night and day"

**Production Notes:**
- Screen share: Show the actual n8n workflow
- Share the prompt (audience loves stealable templates)
- Honest about costs: "This runs me $X/month in API calls"

## 🎤 Why This Will Work

**The Secret:** We're not an AI podcast. We're a BUILD podcast that happens to use AI.

People don't just want information—they want transformation. They want to see someone like them, figuring it out, sharing the wins AND the failures. The Life OS Podcast is that journey, documented in real-time.

**This would be GREAT content!** 🎙️✨

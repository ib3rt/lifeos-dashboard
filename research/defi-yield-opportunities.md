## 1. AAVE (Decentralized Lending Protocol)

### Overview
Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as suppliers (lenders) or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market while earning interest, and borrowers can access liquidity by providing collateral.

### Current Yield Opportunities

| Asset Category | Typical APY Range | Notes |
|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| **USDC** | 4.50% - 6.50% | Variable based on borrowing demand |
| **USDT** | 4.00% - 6.00% | Slightly lower than USDC typically |
| **DAI** | 3.50% - 5.50% | MKR stability fees affect rates |
| **ETH** | 1.50% - 3.50% | Lower as ETH is primarily collateral |

### Key Features
- **Multi-Chain:** Deployed on Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and 7+ other networks
- **Isolation Mode:** Limits exposure to newly listed assets
- **E-Mode:** Enhanced borrowing power for correlated assets (e.g., stablecoins)
- **Flash Loans:** Uncollateralized loans (0.09% fee) for arbitrage and liquidations
- **GHO Stablecoin:** Aave's native stablecoin for additional yield strategies

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Factor | Level | Details |
|-------------|-------|---------|

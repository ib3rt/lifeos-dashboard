## How to Use This

When working with b3rt:
1. **Lead with specifics** — not "what should we do?" but "here are 3 approaches, each with tradeoffs"
2. **Anticipate next steps** — suggest what might break and how to fix it
3. **Be efficient** — skip pleasantries, get to the point
4. **Offer options** — don't dictate, present choices
5. **Persist** — if something fails, iterate rather than escalate

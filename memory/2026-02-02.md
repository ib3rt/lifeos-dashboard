## Genesis Day 🦾

### Session Start
- Time: ~05:35 UTC
- User: b3rt
- Context: Post-config-fix, pre-overnight build

### Key Events
1. **05:35** — Discord config errors identified and fixed (removed from config)
2. **05:55** — Genesis Protocol drafted and committed to memory
3. **06:04** — **AGENT ARMY DEPLOYED**
   - research_agent: Productivity systems & AI architecture research
   - code_agent: CLI toolkit construction
   - docs_agent: System documentation
4. **06:05** — Monitoring cron activated (30min checks)
5. **06:06** — MEMORY.md updated, briefing template created

### Decisions Made
- Skip Discord for now (config complexity), focus on working tools
- Deploy 3 parallel sub-agents for maximum overnight output
- Set up automated monitoring rather than manual checks

### Active Assets
- 3 sub-agents running (1-hour timeout each)
- Cron job: fa5b89f0-b7fc-4dde-8ee3-dfb96255240e
- Expected completion: 14:00 UTC

### Next Actions (for me)
- Continue background organization
- Poll agent status at 30min intervals
- Prepare consolidated morning briefing
- Execute any failed agent retries

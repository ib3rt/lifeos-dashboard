# 🧘 Stress Detection & Mitigation Workflow

*A compassionate system for recognizing, assessing, and responding to stress and overwhelm.*

---

## 🌊 Philosophy

Stress is not weakness—it is signal. This workflow honors stress as the body's wisdom speaking, asking for attention and care. We meet stress with curiosity, not judgment; with response, not repression.

> *"The obstacle is not the enemy. It is the path."*

## 🌅 Closing Wisdom

Stress is not failure. It is feedback. Your body and mind are signaling that something needs attention—whether that is rest, connection, boundary-setting, or support.

You do not need to eliminate stress. You need to:
- **Recognize it early**
- **Respond with compassion**
- **Access the right tools**
- **Know when to seek help**

You are not alone in this. The capacity to feel stress means you care about your life. Let that care extend to yourself.
